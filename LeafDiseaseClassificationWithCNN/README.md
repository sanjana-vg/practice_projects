## Classification of Diseases in Rice Leaves with CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network Model to categorize the given images of the leaves into one of the three diseases that they are affected by.

The RNN model is implemented using Convolutional and Max pooling layers followed by fully connected layers and a Softmax output activation. Batch Normalization is employed to increase the training speed. Dropout Regularization and simple data augmentation techniques are employed to reduce overfitting. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images of leaves.

This implementation uses Python 3 with Numpy and Tensorflow 2.
