## Text Categorization with LSTM

A Recurrent Neural Network Model to categorize the given English text into one of the five categories

The RNN model is implemented using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Unit which enables the model to retain the important attributes/features of words over long sentences. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled news articles. Pre-trained word embeddings are used to assist in generalising the model to words unseen in the training set.

This implementation uses Python 3 with Numpy and low level APIs of Tensorflow.
